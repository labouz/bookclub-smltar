## Linguistics for Text Analysis

![](img/table1.png)

Understanding this hierarchy will help create *natural language features*. For example:    
<<<<<<< HEAD
  - using a text that has been broken into sequences of characters for recurrent neural network - *morphology*  
  - utilizing the part of speech information as feature - *syntax*
  
Most linguists view speech primary to written language (technological). Analyzing written text can be limiting as it less "creative" and more abstract.

## A Glimpse into Morphology

> The study of words, their internal structures and how they are formed

- English has a pretty low ratio of morphemes (smallest unit of part of a word with meaning)  
<<<<<<< HEAD
  - i.e. "un-", "break", "-able"
- Understanding morphological characteristics are beneficial for prop-processing, removing stopwords and end stemming
=======
  - eg "un-", "break", "-able"
- Understanding morphological characteristics are beneficial for pre-processing, removing stopwords, and end stemming

## Different Languages

**Remember, English is NOT the only language**

*BenderRule* : acknowledge that the models being built are typically language-specific.  
<<<<<<< HEAD
  - neglecting to state the language may give a false veneer of language-independence to the work

Thusly, most text used for modeling henceforth will be in English.

## Other Ways Text can Vary

- Dialects (e.e AAVE & detecting hate speech)  
- Evolution of language  
- Usage of slang

Like ML in general, text modeling is very sensitive to the data used for training!
